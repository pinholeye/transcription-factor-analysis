# Transcription-factor-analysis


Functional analysis of predicted transcription factors (TFs)

As pre-requirements please install:
conda : https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ 
jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/install 
pybedtools: https://daler.github.io/pybedtools/main.html 
gprofiler: https://pypi.org/project/gprofiler-official/

We encourage you to use a UNIX-based system. If you run Windows please make sure to change the directories paths. 
We encourage you to run the code cells separately to avoid long runtime for the plots.

Problems you can encounter:

- If "gprofiler" does not work please make sure that you installed it also in your console(bash)
- if that does not solve your problem please rename "Gprofiler" to "grofiler". 
- If this don't solve your problem, please install all packedges with conda 

To start the analysis you need 3 data files: 

- Annotation file in ".bed" format
- Text file with transcription factors in ".txt" file
- The script - "algorithms_epigenetic_script.ipynb"
- The files asked for in Task 3.1 and 3.2 are /cut_interxection.bed and /GO_enrichment/combined.csv.
